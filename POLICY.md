## 🧪 1. Testing & Development Rules
- All extension testing and debugging sessions must be tracked and documented.  
- If **no progress** is made after **1 hour**, the extension **will not be published** to the main repository.  
- “No progress” means no measurable functional improvements, resolved errors, or confirmed working features.

---

## ⏳ 2. Progress Evaluation
- If an extension achieves **at least 50% progress** (core features functional, partial stability, or major components integrated):  
  - It will receive **an additional 3 hours** of testing and debugging.  
- Progress percentage is determined by logs, commits, or measurable feature completion.

---

## 🧰 3. Publishing Criteria
- Only extensions that show **consistent functionality** and **pass debugging** within the allowed time window will be published to the main branch.  
- Extensions failing to meet this criteria will be **shelved** or **abandoned** until further review.

---

## 🛑 4. Quitting Condition
- If, after the extended testing period (3 additional hours), the extension still **fails to function properly** or remains **below 50% completion**,  
  → Development for that extension **may be discontinued**.

---

## 📅 5. Documentation
Each testing session must include:
- Date and duration  
- Summary of what was tested  
- Observed progress (in % or descriptive notes)  
- Next steps or conclusion  

---

## ✅ Example Workflow
1. Start testing → Log start time.  
2. After 1 hour → Evaluate progress.  
   - If <50% progress → Stop and archive branch.  
   - If ≥50% → Continue testing for up to 3 more hours.  
3. After 3 additional hours → Final evaluation.  
   - If still non-functional → Discontinue work.  
   - If functional → Merge/publish to main repo.
